# Weather Analysis for Ireland and the UK
This project provides a detailed analysis of weather trends in Ireland and the UK, focusing on temperature variations, precipitation patterns, and other climatic factors over several decades. This repository contains the Python code for fetching and analyzing weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, focusing on various cities across Ireland and the UK. The project involves gathering raw weather data, processing it, and storing it in CSV format for further analysis. Insights drawn from this analysis aim to aid in understanding the impact of climate change and assist in future weather forecasting.

# Technologies Used
**Python 3.8+:** Primary programming language used.

**Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis and visualization.

**Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

**SciPy:** Used for scientific computing and technical computing.

**Requests:** For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

**Matplotlib:** For generating visualizations (not detailed in the script, but can be integrated for analysis).

**Citipy:** For determining the nearest city to latitude and longitude coordinates.


# Setup and Installation
Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed. Install dependencies with:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

Launch the project by opening the notebook:

**jupyter notebook 'CA_2_B9AI108_Weather_Analysis_for_IE_&_UK.ipynb'**

# Functionality
**API Data Fetching:** Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on dynamically generated geographic coordinates within specified bounds for Ireland and the UK.

**Data Processing:** Cleans and transforms raw API data, such as converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and calculating day lengths.
CSV Output: Outputs cleaned and processed data into CSV files for easy access and further analysis.

# Data Description
The data includes weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions for various cities determined randomly within the geographic confines of Ireland and the UK.
